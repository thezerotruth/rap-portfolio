* **Q&A Structure**: Code logic optimized to generate outputs mirroring specific questions buyers ask AI (e.g., "How do you manage remote SDRs?").

## Evidence & Statistics
* Optimized for **Gemini 1.5 Flash** with a 1M token context window.
* Designed to hit the **3,000 character limit** for high-impact LinkedIn Reference Assets.
